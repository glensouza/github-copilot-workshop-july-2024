# GitHub Copilot Workshop July 2024

In today's rapid evolving technological landscape the adoption of generative AI tools has become a cornerstone of innovation, propelling developers into a new era of efficiency and creativity.

One of these AI tools is called GitHub Copilot and it quickly became the world's most widely adopted AI developer tool. GitHub Copilot is transforming the developer workflow by revolutionizing code generation and auto completion by offering real time code suggestions.

As developers type, Copilot significantly enhances productivity allowing developers to focus on high level logic while automating repetitive tasks.

In this workshop, we'll explore its common use cases understand its transformative benefits and dive into compelling statistics that illustrate how it elevates everyday tasks for developers.

In this era of AI, we'll witness GitHub Copilot's capabilities firsthand, breaking down valuable topics like prompt engineering and context. We'll talk about large language models and GitHub's commitment to security privacy, compliance, and transparency.

And finally, we'll use GitHub Copilot to construct a console an application together that reinforces the concepts learned throughout this workshop.
