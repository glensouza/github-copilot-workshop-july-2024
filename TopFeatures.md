## Agents

There are three agents Workspace, VS Code and Terminal. Agents setup the context for the chat panel and allow Copilot work in a sandboxed environment of your code.

### Workspace Agent

The GitHub Copilot `@workspace` agent enhances code suggestion capabilities by analyzing and understanding the entire context of your workspace, enabling it to make informed recommendations that align with your project's architecture and dependencies. It supports project-specific customization and advanced refactoring, improving code consistency and quality across multiple files.

### VSCode Agent

The `@vscode` agent allows you to ask questions about VS Code. It uses the documentation for VS Code to find your answer and guide you with instructions. For example you could ask `@vscode how do I change my theme`

### Terminal agent

The @terminal agent allows you to ask question about terminal commands or even create commands. For example you could ask @terminal how do I commit using git
